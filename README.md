# Voice assistant "Jarvis"
 My first big Python project which I posted on GitHub.
## Funchins:
- See the weather in your city.

- Search for a location with an IP address.

- Search in Google.
- And tell what time it is.
- This project has a lot of bugs that I may fix someday.Because I did it myself 2 years ago and according to YouTube lessons.
